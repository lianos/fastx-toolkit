Tweaks to the FASTX-Toolkit.

One (useful) tweak is the (default) disabling of quality-score checks
in parsing/manipulating/writing fastq files. The default fastx behavior
can be turned back on by adding the `-S` switch to the command.

FASTX-Toolkit version 0.13 and libgtextutils version 0.6 were used as the base.
